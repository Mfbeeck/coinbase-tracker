# coinbase-tracker
Created this script to track all of my Coinbase cryptocurrencies in one custom dashboard. In this dashboard I am able to track realized and unrealized gains amongst all of my cryptocurrency investments. 

For more information on how to set this up yourself, please see my [medium post](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/tracking-your-coinbase-portfolio-performance-using-python-google-sheets-57d86d687547) detailing exactly how to do so.
