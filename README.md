# coinbase-tracker
Created this script to track all of my Coinbase cryptocurrencies in one custom dashboard. In this dashboard I am able to track:
* Realized and unrealized for all of my cryptocurrency investments
* % Return on each of my cryptocurrencies
* All orders for any cryptocurrency in one sheet
* Average buy prices for each of my cryptocurrencies
* Amount of fees paid on all of my purchases and sales


For more information on how to set this up yourself, please see my [medium post](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/tracking-your-coinbase-portfolio-performance-using-python-google-sheets-57d86d687547) detailing exactly how to do so.
